    "1) Fill the gaps: \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 1) There is a `______________________________________` is often used in a  `_______________________`, based on a mistaken belief that it is a `_______________________`  block rather than an  `_______________________`                                                                . \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 2) The sounds listeners perceive - the ‘phonemes’ - are conditioned `_______________________` , not on a fixed `____________________________________`.                                         . \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 3) The convention is that a `_______________________` consists of IPA symbols between forward slashes, and a `_______________________`   consists of IPA symbols between square brackets \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 4) Individual speech sounds may be ‘heard’ `_______________________`   `_______________________`  and second, whole words or phrases may be ‘heard’                                         ! \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 5) Speakers and listeners continuously balance the`____________________________________`  against the `_______________________________________`  [22] - behaviour that leads to a `_______________________`  (as opposed to signal-based) form of communication [23]. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 6) What is particularly noticeable is that most of these frequently occurring bigram phrases are more related to `___________________________` than to speech science. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 7) What is perhaps most concerning is that `____________`  of the INTERSPEECH-2018 papers that used the term ‘phoneme’ did not provide any form of definition or explanation, presumably because the authors assumed that                                   \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 8) Further analysis of the `________`  accepted papers in INTERSPEECH2018 that contained the term ‘phoneme’ showed that around `____________` used the term in a way that could be construed as `_______________________`. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 9) Other authors clearly assumed that there is a fixed relationship between `_______________________`  and its`___________________________________` , and that boundaries between `____________________________________`  existed and were well defined. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 10) Many authors referred to `_______________________`  and the derivation of `________________________` . One even referred to `___________________________________` ! \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 11) It should be acknowledged that around `_______________`  of the 265 accepted papers in INTERSPEECH-2018 that contained the term ‘phoneme’ `_______________________` the term in an inappropriate manner \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 12) It was noticeable that authors in the areas of `_______________________`  and `____________________________`  were considerably more `_______________________`  in their usage. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 13) In many cases, the term ‘phoneme’ could have been substituted by `_______________________`  with no loss of meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 14) Many language resources are supplied with predefined so called `_______________________`  labels, often using their own `_______________________` symbol sets. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 15) Using forced-alignment with such labels reinforces the superficial`_______________________`  view of speech \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 16) Using the term ‘phoneme’ correctly is certainly a small price to pay to avoid such outcomes, and may even lead to `_________________________________`  into the structure and behaviour of spoken language - especially when coupled with contemporary ideas in deep learning [28], such as `__________________________` [29] and  `_______________________________` [30]. \n",
