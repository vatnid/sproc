    "Write down (with pen and paper or equivalent) answers to the following questions. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "1) Fill the gaps: \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 1) There is a `suspicion` is often used in a  `casual non-scientific sense`, based on a mistaken belief that it is a `concrete acoustic building`  block rather than an  `abstract psychological phenomenon`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2) The sounds listeners perceive - the ‘phonemes’ - are conditioned `on the meaning of an utterance` , not on a fixed `set of acoustic properties`.                                         . \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3) The convention is that a `phonemic transcription` consists of IPA symbols between forward slashes, and a `phonetic transcription` consists of IPA symbols between square brackets \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 4) Individual speech sounds may be ‘heard’ `even though they are not present` and second, whole words or phrases may be ‘heard’ `even though they are not present`! \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 5) Speakers and listeners continuously balance the`effectiveness of communication` against the `effort required to communicate effectively` [22] - behaviour that leads to a `‘contrastive’`  (as opposed to signal-based) form of communication [23]. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 6) What is particularly noticeable is that most of these frequently occurring bigram phrases are more related to `speech technology` than to speech science. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 7) What is perhaps most concerning is that `98%` of the INTERSPEECH-2018 papers that used the term ‘phoneme’ did not provide any form of definition or explanation, presumably because the authors assumed that `everyone knows what it means`.                           \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 8) Further analysis of the `265` accepted papers in INTERSPEECH2018 that contained the term ‘phoneme’ showed that around `40%` used the term in a way that could be construed as `misuse`. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 9) Other authors clearly assumed that there is a fixed relationship between `a ‘phoneme’` and its `acoustic relation` , and that boundaries between `‘phonemic segments’` existed and were well defined. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 10) Many authors referred to `‘phonemic segmentation’` and the derivation of `‘phoneme durations’` . One even referred to `“phoneme chunks”`! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 11) It should be acknowledged that around `60%` of the 265 accepted papers in INTERSPEECH-2018 that contained the term ‘phoneme’ `did not misuse` the term in an inappropriate manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 12) It was noticeable that authors in the areas of `L2 learning` and `low-resource languages` were considerably more `precise` in their usage. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 13) In many cases, the term ‘phoneme’ could have been substituted by `‘phone’` with no loss of meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* 14) Many language resources are supplied with predefined so-called `‘phonemic’` labels, often using their own `non-IPA` symbol sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 15) Using forced-alignment with such labels reinforces the superficial `‘beads-on-a-string’` view of speech \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* 16) Using the term ‘phoneme’ correctly is certainly a small price to pay to avoid such outcomes, and may even lead to `deeper and more valuable insights` into the structure and behaviour of spoken language - especially when coupled with contemporary ideas in deep learning [28], such as `‘generative adversarial networks’` [29] and  `‘attention models’` [30]. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "2) What is Daniel Jones’ definition of a phoneme?\n",
    "- A family of uttered sounds (segmental elements of speech) in a particular language which count for practical purposes as if they were one and the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) What is the phoneme restoration effect?\n",
    "- If a short section of speech was cut out and replaced by another sound (such as a cough), listeners could not detect that anything was missing; the excised sound was restored in the mind of the listener.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Describe the effect illustrated by Sara Hawkins. \n",
    "- Speakers and listeners continuously balance the effectiveness of communication against the effort required to communicate effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5) What % of papers contained the term “phoneme”, “speech recognition” and “speech synthesis” at Interspeech 2018 and ICSLP-1998?\n",
    "- 2018: 34%, 68%, 19%\n",
    "- 1998: 35%, 58%, 17%\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6) What do the authors note is particularly noticeable about Table 3? \n",
    "- Most of the frequently occurring bigram phrases like \"phoneme based\", \"phoneme recognition and \"phoneme sequence\" are more related to speech technology than to speech science.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Of the definitions for the term “phoneme” given at Interspeech 2018, how many were correct? \n",
    "- None\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8) How many papers correctly defined the term “phoneme” at Interspeech 2018? \n",
    "- None\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9) In section 3.3 the authors give a list of examples of the misuse of the term “phoneme” The author gives a short explanation for each that is not comprehensive. Choose 3 examples and explain fully why each is a misuse. \n",
    "- \"We have 252 phonemes, of which there are 213 Mandarin and 39 English.\" One language only has a limited set of phonemes, but here it seems that it's trying to use it to mean the count of each phone in a given dataset.\n",
    "- \"Spectral transitions between phonemes... \" Phonemes are abstract psychological concepts, not the realisation of a sound, so there are no transitions between phonemes, only phones.\n",
    "- \"We propose a language-independent phoneme segmentation method.” Phonemes are sets of groupings of sounds in the head of a native speaker, and this set differs language by language. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10) Do speech technology papers misuse the term as much as speech science papers? \n",
    "- Yes, accounting for the total numbers of papers in the two categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11) What are the 3 recommendations made by the authors in section 4.2? \n",
    "- Researchers shouldn't misuse the term, educators should make sure newcomers understand the difference, and associations should also make sure their members use the terms correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12) Do you now personally understand the meaning of the term phoneme? Bring your questions to the tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "_BONUS QUESTION:_ What is a metaphoneme? \n",
    "- Guess: It's phonemes that two languages varieties have in common\n",
